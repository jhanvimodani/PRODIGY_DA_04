For my fourth task, I'll be diving into sentiment analysis, focusing on uncovering sentiment patterns in social media data. Using a dataset like the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset from Kaggle, I'll analyze and visualize public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands.

Excited to enhance my data analytics and visualization skills while gaining insights into public sentiment! Grateful for the opportunity to learn and contribute at Prodigy InfoTech
